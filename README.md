# Figment Explorer React App(Typescript)

This is the NEAR token explorer written by `smart-dev30`.
All the UI components and containers are written by [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and includes generic [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/) configurations.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
